Let us enjoy reading this Zen Tale of Sleepy Teacher.

A schoolteacher used to take a short nap every afternoon.

When his pupils asked him why he did so, he said that he went to dreamland to meet ancient sages.

One extremely hot day some of the pupils fell asleep in the afternoon. When the school-teacher chided them, they said, "We went to meet the sages in dreamland."

"What did they say?" demanded the teacher.

"We asked them if a school- teacher came there every afternoon, but they said they had seen no such person."
